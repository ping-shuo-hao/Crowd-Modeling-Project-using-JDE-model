# Crowd-Modeling-Project-using-JDE-model
## Introduction
This is a group project that aims to analyze crowd density inside train stations using computer vision. I was responsible for investigating an alternative object detection model to our current model, YOLOv5. My resposibility is to find an adternative object detection model to our current YOLOv5 model. This repo is about using the Joint Detection and Embedding model (JDE). Training data can't be published due to confidential agreement with Rutgers Rail Program http://rail.rutgers.edu/#/home.
The Jupyter notebook contains code that intall all dependecies for the JDE model and code for inference.
